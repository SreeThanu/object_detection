Object Detection using YOLO and ResNet


Project Overview


This project implements object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The model is built on a deep learning framework, utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and classify multiple objects in an image.


The architecture integrates:



YOLOv1: A convolutional network designed to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from images.


ResNet: A residual neural network used to enhance feature extraction and improve detection accuracy.


Model Architecture


YOLO (You Only Look Once)


YOLO formulates object detection as a single regression problem, which simplifies the detection pipeline and speeds up inference. Key features:



Single convolutional network: YOLO divides the image into a grid and simultaneously predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities.


Real-time performance: YOLO processes images much faster than traditional methods.


Generalization: YOLO excels at generalizing well to new domains due to its global reasoning over the entire image.


Residual Networks (ResNet)


ResNet Architecture: ResNet is incorporated for its ability to maintain high accuracy in deep networks by using skip connections to bypass one or more layers.


Feature Extraction: ResNet improves the model's ability to learn robust feature representations, contributing to better object detection accuracy.





Dataset


This project uses the PASCAL VOC 2007 dataset for training and testing. The dataset contains annotated images across 20 different object classes. The VOCdevkit provides the tools for training, testing, and evaluating the object detection model.
